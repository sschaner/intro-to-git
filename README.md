# git init

- Use the command "git init" in your working directory to set up git in your working directory.

# git add

- Working Directory

* Area where all of your files and directories and changes are living all the time

- Staging Area

* Files and directories that we explicitly add to the staging area

- Git Repository

* Where all our snapshots are stored

- "git status" lists the files that are tracked and not tracked (green for tracked and red for untracked)
- "git add <filename>" moves the file from the working directory to the staging area

# git commit

- 'git commit -m "Message here"' moves files in the staging area to the git repository
